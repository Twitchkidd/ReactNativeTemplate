# React Native Template!

Add:

- styled-components
- @react-navigation/native
- react-native-reanimated
- react-native-gesture-handler
- react-native-screens
- react-native-safe-area-context
- @react-native-community/masked-view

I'd only seen `pod install`, what's `npx pod-install ios` ... that will happen right after branching to test.

Import `react-native-gesture-handler` at the top.

No @format.

No @format or @flow.

App in /src.

No Typescript.

Wrap in NavigationContainer.

Colors refactor to utils.

Bracket spacing to true.

Grab Header from NewAppScreen, no Typescript, refactor colors.

ScrollView to AppScrollView with styled-components.

... I forgot to log a bunch of steps. Seems to work! There are a couple issues open. Next step testing navigation.
